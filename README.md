Please use 
"mvn clean verify -Dtest=runners.gistStepsTestSuite serenity:aggregate" 
to run the test and create report

Serenity Report could be found at 
"target/site/serenity/index.html" (open via browser)

P.S:
I forgot to change my git credential before pushing and using my friend's credential instead (using my friend's old laptop). Please believe me :p

Thank you
